# Nixos dots
This is the configuration that I am using for my personal laptop.
The config is using the experimental feature flake, to specify the inputs instead of using nix-channels.

As for my config files I am using home-manager to manage most of it.

## System
Window manager: Hyprland
Text editor: nixvim

TODO:
Convert hyprland config into this config
Fix shiftwidth in nixvim
git fugitiv
add yazi file manager
add zellij multiplexer
## Features
make 4 documents workspace, the workspace should be able to expand, so that if you are on workspace 4 and you press windows 4 you will go to the next document workspace.
